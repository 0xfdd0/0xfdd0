- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xfdd0.  I double-space my sentence breaks, prefer camelCaps, and use Oxford commas.

- 👀 I’m interested in a great many things.  The list itself is far too large for me to enumerate, and in any event would likely change before I finished.  I used to be proud of this, then realized it may be a problem, and have finally come to accept this as a part of me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, rust, and basically all the geekery that has happened in the last decade or so.  I'm also learning to enjoy each moment for the gift that it is, to honor the One who gives them, and to be the best person I can be for all around me.

- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate at the moment.  I'm not against it, but I don't want my unreliabilities to let anyone down.

- 📫 How to reach me?  If you're reading this you likely already know me, but if not, create an issue and I'll do my best to respond.  Please be patient as my personal bandwidth is rather limited.
